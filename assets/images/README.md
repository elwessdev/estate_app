# Assets Directory

This directory is for storing image assets.

Property photos and user profile pictures will be stored here when users add them through the app.

The app uses the `image_picker` package to allow users to:
- Select photos from their gallery
- Take photos with their camera

These images are stored on the device's file system, and their paths are saved in the SQLite database.
